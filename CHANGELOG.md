# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

Format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project doesn't follow strict semantic versioning (it's a classroom tool, not a library), but version numbers roughly mean:

- **Major (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0):** big changes, possibly a new data format
- **Minor (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0):** new features
- **Patch (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1):** bug fixes only

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-08

Initial public release. Migrated from local file-sharing to GitHub.

### Added
- Point tracking via handheld scanner (USB keyboard-emulation or serial/COM)
- Activities with configurable point values
- Raffle (auto and manual modes)
- QR code label generation and printing
- Google Sheets sync (scan log + live standings)
- Backup/restore via JSON export/import
- Rebuild-from-Sheet-log recovery option
- Seating chart, spinner, and pass-tracking tools
- Settings for serial scanner baud rate and auto-reconnect

### Changed
- Genericized terminology throughout the app: "camp" → "school", "camper(s)" → "student(s)"
- Removed identifiable default values (real camp/bunk names) in favor of generic placeholders ("Sample School", "Sample Class 1")
- Removed the hardcoded Parshas Vayelech text from the app itself. The Pesukim tab now starts with an empty starter set; Vayelech is available as an importable example at `samples/vayelech-parsha-sample.csv`

### Notes
- This version does not yet include a `data.version` field or migration function. Adding one is a priority for the next release — see CONTRIBUTING.md for the pattern to use.
